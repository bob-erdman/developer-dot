  ]
}
```

## Explanation

Check the query you sent with your REST call. It is possible a field you've sent with your query is not eligible for ordering or sorting. For more information, check the [documentation for your endpoint here](https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/) or consult [REST's filtering documenation](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/filtering-in-rest/).
