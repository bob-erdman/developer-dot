When you create a tax transaction in AvaTax, you can use the `customerCode` from this\r\nrecord in your `CreateTransaction` API call.  AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and\r\nidentify any certificates linked to this `customer` object.  If any certificate applies to the transaction,\r\nAvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.\r\n            \r\nUsing exemption certificates endpoints requires setup of an auditable document storage for each company that will use certificates.\r\nCompanies that do not have this storage system set up will receive the error `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption\r\ncertificate related APIs.  To check if this company is set up, call `GetCertificateSetup`.  To request setup of the auditable document\r\nstorage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.\r\n\r\n### Security Policies\r\n\r\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin.\r\n* This API depends on the following active services<br />*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro.\r\n","body":{"mode":"raw","raw":"{\"companyId\":0,\"customerCode\":\"ff7fcc38-8b5a-42b5-9bbb-a9f072e90317\",\"alternateId\":\"987654321\",\"name\":\"Dr. Bob Example\",\"attnName\":\"Attn: Receiving\",\"line1\":\"645 Main Street\",\"city\":\"Irvine\",\"postalCode\":\"92614\",\"phoneNumber\":\"(949) 555-1212\",\"faxNumber\":\"949.555.1213\",\"emailAddress\":\"dr.bob.example@example.org\",\"contactName\":\"Alice Smith\",\"lastTransaction\":\"2008-10-08T00:00:00\",\"country\":\"US\",\"region\":\"CA\",\"exposureZones\":[{\"name\":\"Washington\"}]}"}},"response":[]},{"name":"Delete a customer record","request":{"url":"https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com/api/v2/companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerCode}","method":"delete","header":[],"description":"Deletes the customer object referenced by this URL.\r\n            \r\nA customer object defines information about a person or business that purchases products from your\r\ncompany.
