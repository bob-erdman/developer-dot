In addition to webinars, the AvaTax API team will be presenting in-person at live events during October.

Ted Spence, Director of the AvaTax API Team, will make a short presentation on the effectiveness of cached data in a SaaS platform at [New Tech Northwest’s next Seattle event](https://www.newtechnorthwest.com/new-tech-seattle-october-2-2018/), which takes place from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. PT on Oct. 2 at ThinkSpace, located at 1700 Westlake Ave. N., Suite 200 in Seattle.

We’re excited to be participating in this event and grateful to the event organizers for giving us a chance to share our experience building our API with the broader developer community.
