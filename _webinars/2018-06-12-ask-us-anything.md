Office Hours with AvaTax – Ask our Engineers Anything!

Avalara’s crack team of engineers receives dozens of questions every week from developers using our platform, and we want to answer as many as we can. So, we’ve set up a 30-minute series of webinars called Office Hours with AvaTax that takes place at 10 a.m. PT every Tuesday.

Need help estimating tax, reconciling transactions or exemption certificates? Do you have questions about product taxability, calculating tax offline and handling refunds?  If so, Office Hours is your opportunity to ask our expert team of engineers and developers any questions that may be top of your mind about the AvaTax platform.
