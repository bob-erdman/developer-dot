                        <p class="blog-excerpt">In seeking a sales-tax compliance solution, many companies — especially younger, smaller ones — may turn to free tax-rate tables, using them to manually figure out how much sales tax to charge customers. However, although these tables are “free,” they may be costing your company more than you think — in time, resources and potential risk. First of all, manual sales tax compliance – including tax calculation, tax exemptions certificates and sales tax returns – takes up a lot of time and staff resources — and the resources needed are growing. Nearly two-thirds of companies have hired additional staff to...</p>

Many tax rates and tariffs are ad valorem, which means tax is calculated based on the monetary value of the goods sold or shipped. Rates can also be unit-based. Unit-based rates depend on how much of an item is sold or shipped, for example volume, mass, size, or quantity. Unit-based rates apply to many goods such as sugar, e-waste and recycling fees for electronics, lodging, and bottles. These rates have a unit of measurement and quantity. Throughout...</p>

In an earlier video, we covered how your organization’s tax profile is determined. Now, let’s explore the concept of nexus. What exactly is nexus, you may ask?

Nexus is most simply defined as the areas where your organization is required to collect sales tax. To better understand this core tax concept, watch the video above. We guarantee you’ll be a nexus expert in no time!

Before using the AvaTax API, there are a few basic sales tax principles you need to understand. First and foremost is your organization’s tax profile, which is comprised of three key components:

    Where your organization is required to collect sales tax, a principle known as nexus
    The customers your organization exempts from sales tax
    The specific tax rates for the products and services your organization sells

Watch the short video above to get a quick, basic understanding of how your organization’s tax profile is determined.

Let’s begin by understanding how a “Sales” transaction is created, and how it can change over time. The Transaction State Diagram In AvaTax, a sales transaction is an exchange that occurs between two companies. Although other types of transactions exist that can be within a single company - for example, inventory transfer transactions - in today’s use case we will only examine transactions that occur between two...</p>

In the United States, the rule that determines when your company has to obey a particular jurisdiction’s tax law is called ‘Nexus’, so AvaTax uses this word to refer to the overall concept of selecting jurisdictions where you are signed up to collect and remit taxes.

All queries will receive correct recordset counts except for queries on the /api/v2/transactions endpoint. We have delayed the correct implementation of recordset count for the transactions table to the 2.17.2 release. As a result of this change, the release to Sandbox has been rescheduled for Jan 24th.

                        <p class="blog-excerpt">Uploading Batched Transactions One of the most common inquiries we get at Avalara is about the need to reconcile, or publish, a full list of a company’s transactions at the end of the month. Many businesses work by cash register day by day, and at the end of each month they produce a report listing all the transactions that they processed.

Now that the program is winding down, please take note of a few differences between the final release of REST v2 and the preview program you tested in August/September: New URL for REST v2 The...</p>

It works a bit like this: Request POST /api/v2/companies { "name": "Bob's Artisan Pottery" } Result In the result headers, you’ll get back this response that tells you the URL of your newly created object: Location: /api/v2/companies/123 Then, when it’s time to fetch something back, you can retrieve it back using that location, and...</p>
